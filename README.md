# Highfives challange

As a senior full stack engineer you have to implement a new app for the company.

This application has a very simple idea in it's core: give your coleagues highfives, even if you cant
reach them physically.

To do so the app has to satisfy the following requirements
1) Users should be able to login with name and password
2) When the user is logged in the main application page becomes available and it has
- a main feed of highfives (a list of historical records)
- a text field where you can type in your highfive message
- a list of top highfived users with highfive count
3) ???
4) profit


To run this application:

```
npm run dev
```
